# Personal CV
Hey, here's is my personal CV as a front-end developer.

### Built with
- JavaScript
- CSS (Grid, FlexBox)
- HTML

I've added some cool transitions and animations to the page, especially progress bar animation and the main heading fade-in transition.
Also I've created accordion component for the "Projects" section, so you can test it. 

Mobile version of the website and different hover states are also available.
